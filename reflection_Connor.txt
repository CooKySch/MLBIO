The topic of understanding the outcomes of CRISPR-Cas9 repairs is an interesting one to me, with my background in Life Science \& Technology. I thoroughly enjoyed understanding how biological data was processed and represented in Machine Learning models. How the authors settled on representing the sequences and especially the microhomologies in order to perform multi-class classification was cool to me. The teaching assistants were very helpful.

The lectures were interesting, but I feel like they were more recaps of machine learning concepts. In some other subjects such as Recent Topics in Bioinformatics, some subjects came about that I felt were much more related to Machine Learning in Bioinformatics; for example DNA-Bert was discussed last year. As the master track Data Science \& Technology already focuses a lot on Machine Learning and having this topic be more focused on the applications that people use in different fields would appeal more. For example, machine learning applications in the analysis of proteomics, sequence-based machine learning and other current hot topics.
