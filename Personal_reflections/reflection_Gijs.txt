Overall I was pleased with most of the structure of this course. The flipped classroom, is a nice concept which works perfect in a smaller course such as this. It makes you more aware on the difficulties but also on the pleasures of explaining a topic which you know know from the inside out. Additionally I liked how to project was structured. It taught me the importance of reproducing while also allowing for some creativity for the individual part. What I thought the course lacked is that most topics we discussed during the lecture were just machine learning algorithms that I had already studied at different courses. The lecture lacked the BioInformatics aspect of the course that I was hoping to find in this course, especially for me as a computer science student. Luckily this aspect was more apparent in the project but I had hoped to see it more during the lectures in the form of more specialised algorithms.
